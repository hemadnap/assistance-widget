Branding:
   - What naming convention has to be used on the widget components ?


Edge cases:
   - The user already sent feedback, the device ID prevent him from sending new feedback.


Design:
   - The user submits a fedback, does the widget displays a success message ? Does it closes ? 
   - What happens when we click on the pre-footer buttons:
      - chat: open the chat widget
      - Phone: ?
      - Contact form: ?
      - Appointment: ?
   - When the feedback widget closes, does it stay somewhere ? Minimized version, at the bottom of the screen ?
   - Feedback text has a limit of 256 characters.
   - Info to the user to not disclose personal info.
